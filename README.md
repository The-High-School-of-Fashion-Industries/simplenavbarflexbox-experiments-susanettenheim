# simpleNavFlexbox
First simple Nav bar using Flexbox for commenting and experimentation. 
<br>
First: comment every line of code. (If there are multiple lines that do one thing, you can comment the group)
<br>
Next: make some changes and then comment out your changes. comment you changes so that you know if you uncomment them and comment out some other code - you know what to expect - what will change and why?
